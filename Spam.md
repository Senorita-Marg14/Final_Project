## Spam Filters 
Spam filters are used to sort emails that are identified as spam into the spam folder so that they're not clogging up your inbox and protecting you from potential scams. Your spam folders protect you by analyzing a few portions of the email. AI has been increasingly used to help identify spam emails by identifying common themes among spam emails and using these themes to identify more spam mail. 
1. Sender Information: The email server will look at the sender's information to make sure it matches the [Sender Policy Framework](Authentication.md) or other authentication methods. It will also ensure that the email comes from a legitimate server to ensure safety.
2. Content: The server will examine the content of the email and look for common phrases that are associated with scams (like WIN NOW, FREE, ACT FAST). Strange formatting (like misspelled words and excessive punctuation or capitalization) may trigger the server to flag the email. Attachments and links are also scanned to ensure that they are safe to open or download to your device.
3. Engagement Analysis: If your email server notices that you are not routinely opening emails from a source, it may decide to flag it as spam, and future emails from this sender will be routed straight to the spam folder.
4. Blacklists: Emails that have been identified as being spam or fraudulent will be sent to your spam folder in order to decrease the likelihood of being scammed.
