# Emails 

Email providers use many security measures to help ensure your safety when using email. Features like Encryption, Authentication, Spam Filters, and Malware Protection. Some of the phrases you may have heard of, and others you may not have, so let's break these features down so you have a better understanding of just how they're helping to protect you. (To get a more in-depth breakdown of the systems mentioned, click the link associated with each term. 

### Encryption
There are quite a few protocols that go into email encryption, but I'm going to break down two of the key players in keeping your email secure. Transport Layer Security (TLS), works to protect emails as they're being sent from one account to another. End-to-end encryption (E2EE) makes sure that emails are encrypted once you hit send, and can only be decrypted by the person's account that you sent it to. 

### Authentication
When you log into your email account with your username and password, you are authenticating to the email server that you are the person that owns the account, and that you are the person that should be reading emails sent to you. Email servers can verify that your emails are protected using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM). All of these systems work to ensure that you are the only person that is accessing your emails. 

### Spam Filters
We all know that annoying feeling of trying to search for your order confirmation email after you just ordered a brand-new pair of shoes from a website. You keep clicking refresh and clicking around other inboxes until you find it located in your spam folder. While this may feel annoying at times, your email server is just doing its best job at trying to protect you from attacks. Some email servers use AI-Filters or Blacklists to identify emails that they think might be harmful to you. 

### Malware Protection
Sometimes you might get a strange email that pops up in your inbox that tells you that you've won a prize and all you have to do is follow the link provided to claim it. Whatever you do, DO NOT CLICK THAT LINK, no matter how good the prize seems. This is a common scam that works to try and lead you to fake websites or install malware on your laptop. To protect you from these scams, email servers use Attachment Scanning and URL Scanning to prevent you from getting these scary links, but this isn't always a fool proof system. So if you think something sounds too good to be true, trust your gut.
