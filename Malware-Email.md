## Attachment and URL Scanning Email 
When you receive an email that includes an attachment, the server will provide a scan of the attachment to make sure that the attachment is safe. There are a few things that these scans look for. 
1. Malware Signatures: Email servers will scan attachments and look for known malware signatures (ex. .exe, .vbs, .js) or make sure the file format matches the type of content being displayed in the file.
2. Sandbox Analysis: Some advanced email systems have a virtual sandbox (An isolated environment where things can be opened and tested) which allows them to open attachments in emails and see how they interact with the isolated environment and see if they are malware or not.
3. URL Scanning: If the email contains a URL link, the email server will cross-reference the URL link against known malware links and determine whether they are safe. In this scan, they also look for embedded objects in the URL that can execute malware when the link is opened.
