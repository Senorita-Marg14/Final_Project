# Social Media 
We all love to use social media to watch cute dog videos, look at family pictures, or get news (I don't recommend this one at all, but that's what people do). Social media is a great place to stay connected, but can also be a dangerous place full of scammers and potential threats to your security. Social media companies use many features to help protect you from these threats like strong passwords, data encryption, privacy controls, and content moderation. Let's take a deeper look at these features. 

### Passwords 
[Passwords](Passwords.md) are what we use to log into our social media accounts, so you must make a strong password that cannot be guessed easily. Alongside Passwords, [Multifactor Authentication](Authentication.md) can also used to secure your account. 

### Data Encryption
Social media platforms use data encryption to send messages, make posts, and store data. Messaging platforms will often use [End-to-End Encryption](Encryption.md) and [Transport Layer Security](Encryption.md) to ensure the content of messages is protected. Multifactor authentication is used to protect accounts and verify that the correct users are accessing the account.

### Privacy Controls 
[Privacy controls](Privacy.md) can be used to limit who has access to your social media accounts, whether that be messaging, interacting, or even viewing your posts. In the settings of most social media apps, you will find the privacy menu where you can see all of the privacy options that the social media platform offers. 

### Content Moderation
[Content moderation](ContentModeration.md) can be used to hide or show specific content. You may choose to mute an account because you think they're annoying, or just don't like the content that they're posting. Other times, the social media platform may mute or ban accounts that are making inappropriate or harmful posts.
