# Social Media 
We all love to use social media to watch cute dog videos, look at family pictures, or get news (I don't recommend this one at all, but that's what people do). Social media is a great place to stay connected, but can also be a dangerous place full of scammers and potential threats to your security. Social media companies use many features to help protect you from these threats like strong passwords, data encryption, privacy controls, and content moderation. Let's take a deeper look at these features. 

### Passwords 
[Passwords](Passwords.md) are what we use to log into our social media accounts, so you must make a strong password that cannot be guessed easily. Alongside Passwords, [Multifactor Authentication](Authentication.md) can also used to secure your account. 

### Data Encryption

### Privacy Controls 

### Content Moderation
