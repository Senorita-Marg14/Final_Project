# Passwords
When you make a social media account, it is important to use a strong email password. Here are some tips that you should follow to make sure your password is strong 
1. Length: A strong password should be more than 12 characters long, but longer is always more secure.
2. Uniqueness: Avoid using common words, names, or birthdates that can be easily guessed as your password. Instead try to use unique words that are memorable to you, but may be hard to guess for others.
3. Reusing Passwords: Do not reuse passwords, if you reuse a password, it can cause your other accounts to be susceptible to hacking if one of those accounts is compromised.
4. Complexity: Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in your passwords. This makes them harder to guess and less susceptible to hacking.
5. Saving Passwords: Lots of passwords can be hard to keep track of, so use a secure way to store your passwords. Examples of this could be a locked file on your computer, using the remember password feature on your device, or physically locked in a safe or another secure location. If you choose to remember passwords on your device, make sure that you are the only user of the device you're remembering the passwords on, do not save your passwords to public devices.
