# Intro
Over this most recent holiday break, I made a trip to visit my lovely grandparents for Thanksgiving. As we know, grandparents are good at many things, cooking, spoiling their grandkids, and telling long stories that don't seem to have an end point. One of the things they are not very skilled in though is technology, and it was during this visit that I had the joy of helping to set up both my grandparent's Apple accounts and teaching them the basic functions of how an iPhone works. After almost 2 hours of fielding many questions about hacking and eventually turning off the new Apple intelligence feature because my grandpa said "It's going to hack into my accounts and steal all my data", I realized that I had the perfect idea for a digital concept for my final, how cybersecurity works for you and how to better protect your data online. 

I have always been very interested in the cybersecurity field especially how complex online scams have become today. So I wanted to create a repository for information on what measures are put in place to protect your data, and what you can do to keep your data secure.
