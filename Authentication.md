# Authentication

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
When you attempt to log into your account, you may notice that after you enter your password, it asks you to confirm your login session using your phone or another device. This might seem annoying, but it's just one way that your account is trying to keep you protected. There are three main ways that multi-factor authentication occurs. 
1. Secondary Device: As mentioned before, some email accounts will require you to confirm your login session on another device that you're already logged into the account on. This often just requires you to click yes to confirm the login attempt
2. Codes: Other MFAs require you to have access to a phone number or email that can be used to deliver a one-time code that can be used to authenticate your login. Once you enter your username and password, a prompt to enter a code is shown and a numeric code is sent to one of your devices that you must enter to allow the login to continue.
3. Biometric: Now that many laptops, phones, and tablets have biometric scanning abilities, these may also be used for authentication. Once you enter your username and password, you may get a prompt to use your fingerprint or face to verify that it is you who's trying to log in. If you're using face id, you don't have to smile or make a crazy face, just make sure that the camera can see your entire face in order to authenticate.
