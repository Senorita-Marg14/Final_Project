# Websites
When surfing the web, you're probably going to find a lot of cool websites to find information on. But there are some important things to keep in mind while browsing the internet. Reputable websites will use a variety of safety features like Web Protocols, Authentication, and Firewalls to keep your data safe. 

# Web Protocols 
Safe websites will use features like [Secure Socket Layer (SSL)](WebProtocols.md) and [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](WebProtocols.md) to ensure that your data is protected on these websites. A good way to check that the website that you are using is secure is to check the address bar for the padlock icon, which indicates that the website is secure. Another good way to check for safety is that the website starts with [https://](WebProtocols.md)

# Authentication
[Authentication](Authentication.md) features are used on websites to ensure that only the correct user can view their data. Multifactor Authentication and other protocols are used to ensure this. 

# Firewalls 
[Firewalls](Firewalls.md) are used by websites to monitor the traffic that is coming and going from the website. They operate based on rules that are unique to each firewall. Their main goal is to allow for safe and efficient data transfer while keeping out unauthorized or malicious attacks.
